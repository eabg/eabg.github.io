				Hello all, my name is Ehidin and I'm a Fuckin' Libra!  I was born and raised in LA. I moved up to the bay area 5 years and currently live in Oakland. I consider myself a shy and sometimes awkward indivdual upond meeting people but once I'm confortable I can take the lead with chatting. It wouldn't be right to not mention that Im a lover of Disney. I like to visit the parks often so I go at least 3 times a year in Socal. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I do have children and they come with paws. I have a two cats (Pepper and Lucy) and also a dog that goes by the name of Roxy (shes in the photo). I really enjoy being outdoors and star gazing. On my free time I like to meditate and pratice with my tarot cards. I love to travel and would like to do more of it. Other than that I like to sit at home and watch nexflix. Other interest of mine are drawing, people watching, Bingo, hiking, and playing tennis. These are little things about me.
